👩‍💼 HR-Analytics-Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition and workforce distribution using Power BI for dashboard visualization. The goal is to uncover attrition patterns, evaluate the impact of salary, job role, education, and age on employee turnover, and provide actionable insights to improve employee retention.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

Microsoft Power BI – For interactive dashboard creation and data visualization

DAX Measures – For KPIs like attrition rate, average salary, tenure, and department-wise attrition

Power Query (ETL in Power BI) – For data transformation and cleaning

Excel / CSV Dataset – For preprocessing raw HR data

🔍 Process Followed

1. Data Collection

HR dataset containing details of employees including age, salary, gender, education, job role, department, and attrition status.

2. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed null and duplicate records.

Standardized categorical values (e.g., job roles, education fields).

Created new KPIs: Attrition Rate, Avg Age, Avg Salary, Avg Years at Company.

3. Data Analysis (via DAX in Power BI)

Calculated metrics for employee count, attrition, and salary distribution.

Segmented employees by job role, education, age group, and years of service.

Derived gender-wise and department-wise attrition insights.

4. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

Developed multiple interactive views:

Overall Summary – Employee count, attrition rate, average age, average salary, and tenure.

Education & Age Analysis – Attrition by education background and age groups.

Salary Analysis – Attrition by salary range.

Tenure Analysis – Attrition by years at company.

Job Role Analysis – Attrition by job role and department distribution.

5. Insights Extraction

Interpreted dashboard visuals to generate business insights on employee retention.
